# Costs

Although the module itself is open-source and free to use, the entire setup incurs costs due to the services utilized. These costs primarily depend on the instance type and volume size that you choose. Additionally, there will be minimal costs associated with AWS for the Terraform state S3 bucket. It is advisable to review the pricing details of the services you plan to utilize to understand the overall expenses involved.
